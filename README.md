An HTTP server for receiving and handling notifications (e.g: for tasks that
ended) and an accompanying client - both written in Perl and available
as CPAN distributions:

- [App-Notifier-Client](http://metacpan.org/release/App-Notifier-Client)
- [App-Notifier-Service](http://metacpan.org/release/App-Notifier-Service)

There is also a [page](https://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/projects/notifier-apps/)
for them on my site.
